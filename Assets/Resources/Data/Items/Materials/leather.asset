  SourceDescription: Leather cannot be found directly in the environment but can
    be obtained from storage spaces within the game world. It can be reliably acquired
    by hunting various animals, as they guarantee a leather drop. Skinwalkers, on
    the other hand, also has the chance to drop leather, but this is not guaranteed.
