The Metrics Interface is used to collect data on game usage and populate the Game Analytics dashboard in the EOS portal.

To use the demo, simply fill out the display name field and select a controller type (and optionally a session ID and a server IP in IPv4 or IPv6 format), then press the Begin Session button. This will start a Metrics tracking session, which will complete upon pressing the End Session button.
